                </p>
                <p><span class="bo">8.  Your Content.</span>  "Your Content" means reports, data, text, audio, video, images, graphics, messages, files, attachments or other materials that you submit to, or create within, the Services in connection with your account.  Solely you are responsible for properly using the Services and taking your own steps to maintain appropriate security, protection and backup of Your Content.  Because it is not possible to guarantee data security, you acknowledge that it may be possible for an unauthorized party to access Your Content, and you agree that, in such event, any loss that you may suffer is subject to the Limitation of Liability section of this Agreement. </p>
                <p>Solely you are responsible for Your Content.  You retain ownership rights that you may have in Your Content.  We display, store and otherwise process Your Content solely at your direction.  To the extent that we need a license to provide such display, storage and other processing services to you, you hereby grant to us, the Affiliated Entities and each of our and their respective service providers and designees a worldwide, non-exclusive, transferable, fully sublicenseable (through multiple tiers), royalty-free, fully paid-up, perpetual, irrevocable license, without additional consideration to you or any third party, to use, reproduce, distribute, perform and display (publicly or otherwise), create derivative works of, adapt, modify, and otherwise use and exploit Your Content, in any format or media now known or hereafter developed, for the sole purpose of providing the Services and related customer service to you and other users designated by you.  You represent and warrant that you have all rights necessary for you to grant the license granted in this section and that Your Content and your provision of it to and through the Site comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations and do not violate the rights of any person.  You agree to cooperate with us, at our request, in responding to any claims relating to Your Content.  We may disclose your account information and Your Content to any person as we reasonably believe necessary or appropriate:  (i) if we are required to do so to comply with legal process or governmental request, (ii) to enforce this Agreement, (iii) to detect or prevent security, fraud or technical issues, (iv) to protect the rights, property and/or safety of us, our users, you or any other person, or (v) as permitted by law. </p>
                <p>Solely you are responsible for determining and identifying which third parties shall have access (and what level of access) to Your Content.  We are not responsible for any such third party's access of Your Content. </p>
                <p><span class="bo">9.  Submissions.</span>  The Site may make available certain functionality (such as Forums) through which you are able to post or send information and materials in connection with community-focused areas of the Site (each, a <span class="bo">"Submission"</span>).  "Submissions" do not include Your Content.  For purposes of clarity, you retain ownership rights that you may have in any Submission that you post, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.  We do not claim ownership over any of your Submissions; however, we need certain rights to your Submissions to be able to make them available through the Site.  Accordingly, you hereby grant to the Company, the Affiliated Entities and each of their respective service providers and designees a worldwide, non-exclusive, transferable, fully sublicenseable (through multiple tiers), royalty-free, fully paid-up, perpetual, irrevocable license, without additional consideration to you or any third party, to use, reproduce, distribute, perform and display (publicly or otherwise), create derivative works of, adapt, modify, and otherwise use and exploit such Submission, in any format or media now known or hereafter developed, and for any purpose (including promotional purposes).</p>
                <p>For each Submission, you represent and warrant that you have all rights necessary for you to grant the license granted in this section and that such Submission, and your provision of it to and through the Site, comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations and do not violate the rights of any person.  You further irrevocably waive any "moral rights" or other rights with respect to attribution of authorship or integrity of materials regarding each Submission that you may have under any applicable law under any legal theory.  We request this license and waiver to help ensure that we have all the rights we may need to provide the Services available through the Site.</p>
                <p><span class="bo">10.  Monitoring.</span> We may (but have no obligation to) monitor, evaluate, refuse to post, remove or alter Submissions before or after they appear on the Site.  We may disclose any Submissions and the circumstances surrounding their transmission to anyone for any reason.</p>
                <p><span class="bo">11.  Your Suggestions.</span>  You grant to Company all right, title and interest to any suggestion, recommendation or other feedback that you provide to us.  In the event this grant is not sufficient, you grant to Company a royalty-free, fully paid-up, worldwide, transferable, sub-licensable, irrevocable, perpetual license to use and incorporate into its products and/or services (including the Site) any of your suggestions, recommendations or other feedback.</p>
                <p><span class="bo">12.  Our Proprietary Rights.</span>  We and/or our licensors and suppliers own the information and materials made available through the Site, excluding Your Content.

You may not use our trade names, trademarks or service marks in connection with any product or service that is not ours, in any manner that is likely to cause confusion.  Nothing contained on the Site should be construed as granting any license or right to use any trade names, trademarks or service marks without the express prior written consent of the owner.</p>

YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY FOR DISSATISFACTION WITH THE SITE IS TO STOP USING THE SITE.  THE MAXIMUM LIABILITY OF THE RELEASED PARTIES FOR ALL DAMAGES, LOSSES AND CAUSES OF ACTION, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE, SHALL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNTS, IF ANY, THAT YOU HAVE PAID TO US FOR YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES.</p>
                <p>Applicable law may not allow for limitations on certain implied warranties or exclusions or limitations of certain damages; solely to the extent that such law applies to you, some or all of the above disclaimers, exclusions or limitations may not apply to you, and you may have additional rights.</p>
                <p>While we try to maintain the security of the Site, we do not guarantee that it will be secure or that any use of the Site will be uninterrupted.

                <p><span class="bo">16.  Termination.</span>  This Agreement is effective until terminated.  We, in our sole discretion, may terminate your access to or use of the Site at any time and for any reason, including if we believe that you have violated or acted inconsistently with the letter or spirit of this Agreement.

                <p><span class="bo">19.  Filtering.</span>  Pursuant to 47 U.S.C. Section 230(d) as amended, we hereby notify you that parental control protections (such as computer hardware, software or filtering services) are commercially available that may assist you in limiting access to material that is harmful to minors.  Information identifying current providers of such protections is available on the two web sites GetNetWise (http://kids.getnetwise.org/) and OnGuard Online (http://onguardonline.gov/). We do not endorse any of the products or services listed at such site. </p>
                <p><span class="bo">20.  Claims of Copyright Infringement.</span>  The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the <span class="bo">"DMCA"</span>) provides recourse for copyright owners who believe that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under U.S. copyright law.  If you believe in good faith that materials available on the Site infringe your copyright, you (or your agent) may send us a notice requesting that we remove the material or block access to it.  If you believe in good faith that someone has wrongly filed a notice of copyright infringement against you, the DMCA permits you to send us a counter-notice.  Notices and counter-notices must meet the then-current statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA.  See http://www.copyright.gov/ for details.  </p>
                <p><span class="bo">21.

You may not export any Services or software available on or through the Site except as authorized by United States law. </p>
                <p><span class="bo">22.  Miscellaneous.</span>  This Agreement does not, and shall not be construed to, create any partnership, joint venture, employer-employee, agency or franchisor-franchisee relationship between you and us.  If any provision of this Agreement is found to be unlawful, void or for any reason unenforceable, that provision will be deemed severable from this Agreement and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provision.  You may not assign, transfer or sublicense any or all of your rights or obligations under this Agreement without our express prior written consent.  We may assign, transfer or sublicense any or all of our rights or obligations under this Agreement without restriction.  No waiver by either party of any breach or default hereunder will be deemed to be a waiver of any preceding or subsequent breach or default.  Any heading, caption or section title contained herein is inserted only as a matter of convenience, and in no way defines or explains any section or provision hereof.  The term "including" as used herein means "including without limitation."
