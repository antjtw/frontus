						<h2>Robert Walport</h2>
						<p><strong>Software Engineer</strong></p>
						<p>Robert was born in Blighty, growing up in London and eventually reading Physics at Oxford. He jumped across the pond for a pair of master&apos;s degrees, Journalism and Computer Science, at Columbia University before joining the Sharewave team in January 2013. He previously took a brief sojourn into the arts working at the Brooklyn Academy of Music (BAM), but he had to talk to far too many people so decided software engineering was a safer pursuit.</p>
